        <p>I really enjoy watching K-dramas and C-dramas. K-dramas always touch my heart with their emotional stories, beautiful music, and amazing actors. C-dramas are special to me because they are colorful, romantic, and often have unique plots. Both make me laugh, cry, and feel connected to the characters, and I never get bored of watching them.</p>
